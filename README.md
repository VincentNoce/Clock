# Clock

# An application for C++ that displays or adds time to a clock in 24-hour or 12-hour formats. The clock's time representation is manipulated through a simple interface. This project facilitates the management and viewing of time for users.

# What was done particularly well:

# Well-defined functions make it easy to read and maintain the code.

# User inputs are checked to ensure they are within the specified range by implementing error handling.

# There are options to display time in 12-hour and 24-hour formats, enhancing the program's usability.

# Enhancements that could be made:

# There is potential for improving error handling further by providing more detailed error messages when invalid inputs are received.

#  In order to make the code more understandable and readable for other developers, it could benefit from additional comments and documentation.

# Run-time errors may need to be handled with exceptions, for example, division by zero when adding the time.

# Challenges and how they were overcome:

# By using modular arithmetic and converting between 24-hour and 12-hour formats as needed, this code simplifies time arithmetic, which could potentially be challenging.

# Although no specific tools or resources were mentioned in the code, it is possible to find assistance online or consult C++ documentation if any difficulties arise.

# Other projects that can benefit from these skills:

# Developing a command-line interface that is user-friendly.

# Providing error-checking mechanisms and handling user input.

# Date and time representations.

# Using user input to modify and update variables in code.

# Maintainability, readability, and adaptability of the program:

# Clear variable names and well-named functions make code easier to read.

# It is modular and easy to extend and modify because it is organized into functions.

# In order to make the program more maintainable and adaptable, constants and descriptive output messages are used.
